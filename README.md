![SSH Honeypot](https://www.example.com/ssh_honeypot_image.png)

Welcome to the SSH Honeypot Project "Pshitt" repository on Azure! This project focuses on deploying an SSH honeypot infrastructure on Azure using Terraform. By leveraging the power of Terraform, this project allows you to easily set up a honeypot environment that logs unauthorized access attempts and integrates with AbuseIPDB for threat analysis. With an enhanced version of Pshitt, you can also disable SSH access and manage the honeypot environment through Azure's Serial Console feature.
